    "A database is an organized collection of data that is stored and managed in a computer system. It can be used to store and retrieve information for various purposes, including data analysis, decision making, and record keeping.\n",

    "SQL databases use a structured format that consists of tables with predefined columns and rows. They are best suited for handling structured data, which is data that can be organized into tables with fixed fields. SQL databases are known for their scalability, reliability, and security. Some popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured data, such as text, images, and video. They are more flexible than SQL databases and can handle large volumes of data with ease. NoSQL databases do not use a fixed schema, so they can easily adapt to changing data structures. Some popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis.\n",

For example, in an \"orders\" table, the foreign key could be the \"customer_id\" column, which refers to the \"customer_id\" column in the \"customers\" table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables, and it ensures that each order is associated with a valid customer.\n",
